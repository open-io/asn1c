CUSTOM DIRECTORIES INSTALLATION
===============================

Considering you want to build asn1c and install it under the custom directory
${DST}, it is necessary to tell asn1c of that directory so that it will be able
to install files from that location.

The right way to do so is to provide the directory that directory at the
configuration step (with the --prefix option) BUT NOT at the installation step
(with the DESTDIR option).

./configure --prefix=${DST} --enable-{static,shared}
make
make check
make install
